**Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores**

**Project Description**

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admission process.

In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

I looked at how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!

**Project Tasks**
1. Inspecting the data
2. Finding missing values
3. Schools by building code
4. Best schools for math
5. Lowest reading score
6. Best writing school
7. Top 10 schools
8. Ranking boroughs
9. Brooklyn numbers
