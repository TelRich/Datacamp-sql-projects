**What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses**

**Project Description**

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data I explored is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first used joining techniques to merge the data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

**Project Tasks**
1. The oldest business in the world
2. How many businesses were founded before 1000?
3. Which businesses were founded before 1000?
4. Exploring the categories
5. Counting the categories
6. Oldest business by continent
7. Joining everything for further analysis
8. Counting categories by continent
9. Filtering counts by continent and category
