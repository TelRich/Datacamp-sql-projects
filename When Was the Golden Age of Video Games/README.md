**When Was the Golden Age of Video Games**

**Project Description**

In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics like best, and i explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search involved joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I also filtered, grouped, and ordered data.

**Project Tasks**
1. The ten best-selling video games
2. Missing review scores
3. Years that video game critics loved
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list
6. Years video game players loved
7. Years that both players and critics loved
8. Sales in the best video game years
